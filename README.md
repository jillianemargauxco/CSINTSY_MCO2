 Family Relationships Chatbot

The chatbot developed for this project is designed to understand and process family relationships using a logic-based inference system. It accepts user prompts in the form of statements or questions, encodes them into a knowledge base using PROLOG, and provides intelligent responses. This chatbot is tailored to exhibit basic reasoning about family structures while ensuring ease of use and interaction.
